            <P>The Sea Dragon is the largest chemical rocket ever designed matched only by the Interplanetary Transport System (ITS the predecessor to the SpaceX Starship). The Sea Dragon could lift 550 Tonnes to LEO (low earth orbit). For reference, the Saturn V could lift 118 Tonnes to LEO. The ITS was designed to lift 550 Tonnes to LEO only in its expendable mode and 300 Tonnes in reusable. The Sea Dragon is a two-stage rocket that is reusable for more than 100 launches.  It is the best rocket for colonizing space as we will need a super-heavy rocket to do so. Its ability to lift large payloads means it would be able to lift massive space station modules allowing us to build space stations that would dwarf the ISS. Or it could even lift whole space stations to orbit in a single launch. This rocket could be used to build a space station with large fuel and oxidizer tanks to dock with and refuel spacecraft. Then send the spacecraft into deep space for building things like LOP-G (Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway) which is a small, planned space station that will orbit the Moon. It will be used to help with the Artemis program. With such large space stations, we would be able to send more people at a time and have them on board for longer. That is one of the benefits of the ISS as its size allows for longer missions that can last for a year and house seven crew members at a time. Instead of the 21-day missions planned for lop-g. The Sea Dragon can also be used to lift modules with thicker insulation to protect against radiation allowing us to put a bunker on the space stations for the astronauts to hide in during a solar storm. It was designed to be simple to build to cut the cost. It would be built out of cheap materials in a shipyard then towed into a specially built lagoon where it would be assembled and then launched from the sea. It would also be great for putting larger habitats on the Moon for long term missions and events to build a colony on the Moon or anywhere else in the solar system. </P>
